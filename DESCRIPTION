Title: Convenience Functions by Michael Chirico
Author: Michael Chirico

Depends: R (>= 3.2.2)
Description: A set of functions, some subset of which I use in every .R file I write. Examples are table2, which adds useful functionalities to base table (sorting, built-in proportion argument, etc.); lyx.xtable, which converts xtable output to a format more easily copy-pasted into LyX; pdf2, which writes a plot to file while also displaying it in the RStudio plot window; and abbr_to_colClass, which is a much more concise way of feeding many types to a colClass argument in a data reader.
